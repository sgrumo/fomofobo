## 2026-10-15 · Stack moved to Cloudflare Workers, D1 and R2

### Changed

fomofobo ships on Cloudflare Workers, D1 and R2 in place of the PostgreSQL, S3, Vercel and Docker stack of the template. The database layer, the photo uploads, the E2E harness and the deploy pipeline move before any domain code.

### Why

A decision. The functional analysis names Cloudflare, and the template targets another stack.

### Check next time

Confirm the hosting and database target against the template stack before the estimate.
